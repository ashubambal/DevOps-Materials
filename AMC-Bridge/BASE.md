## 🎯 Q1. How do you explain what DevOps methodology or culture means?

### ✅ Answer

> 💡 **For me, DevOps is not just a set of tools or processes — it’s a cultural shift in how organizations build, deliver, and operate software.**

At its core, DevOps is about:

- 🔹 Breaking down **silos** between Development and Operations  
- 🔹 Fostering collaboration  
- 🔹 Creating shared accountability  
- 🔹 Delivering continuous value to customers

## 🧠 Core Philosophy of DevOps

Over the years, DevOps has evolved into a **mindset** where:

| Speed | Stability | Scalability |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 🚀 Faster releases | 🔒 Reliable systems | 📈 Growth-ready architecture |

DevOps ensures these three coexist — not compete.

## ⚙️ Key Technical Practices in DevOps

DevOps emphasizes:

- 🔄 **Continuous Integration (CI)**
- 🚀 **Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)**
- 🏗 **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
